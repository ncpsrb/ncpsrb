# Bank Mandiri Automation Projects

---

## Autodeployment (2021)

**Problem:** Deployment of Bank Process Reengineering (BPR) applications across multiple environments was manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming.  
**Solution:** Designed and implemented an RPA-driven deployment automation that standardized rollout steps, eliminating manual intervention.  
**Impact:** Reduced deployment time significantly, minimized risks of human error, and ensured consistent delivery across environments.  
**Tech Stack:** UiPath, RPA, VBs

## Automation Testing (2022)

**Problem:** Manual quality assurance for critical banking systems such as MCM, BPR (KPR/KSM), Credit Card, Core Banking, and Treasury was inefficient and error-prone.  
**Solution:** Built comprehensive automated testing workflows, including regression suites and reporting dashboards integrated with SQL databases.  
**Impact:** Shortened regression testing cycles from weeks to days, increased coverage, and improved system reliability before production releases.  
**Tech Stack:** UiPath, Test Automation, VBs, Macros, SQL
